# Bubble-Map-Visualization-FastFood

## Background & Objectives

In this exercise we will analyze the data about fast food chains in the U.S.A. Using plotly we are going to develop different bubble plots having geographical maps as a background.

## Data

**The Dataset**: let's analyze - from a graphical point of view - this [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/fast-food-restaurants) about fast food restaurants.

## Tools

For this challenge, we will work with Jupyter Notebook and some Python libraries such as pandas, numpy and plotly in order to develop an interactive plot.
